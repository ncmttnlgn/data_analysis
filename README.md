how to pull the data and connect it with the Google API using Python In this project, Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries were used by using Python language.In order to connect to Selenium internet, chromedriver.exe file must be run in the enclosed file. By connecting to Defactoâ€™s website on the Internet and filtering what is needed to me in the HTML code, I have provided the necessary data on the filtered data. My goal here is to use selenium on the site because of the dimensions and stocks of products come after page rendering, I noticed that the product sizes and stocks came after clicking a button. I couldn't shoot BeautifulSoup. Thanks to Selenium, I was able to calculate the product option after clicking the button and providing the necessary product information to be reflected in HTML. But the computer and internet I used were insufficient for me to do this job. Because there was a lot of data. When a good machine and internet are provided, I can extract this data in a healthy way. When printing the api, I was able to print a certain number of data due to the quota of the google api.
